    {Senior Infrastructure Engineer} % Job title
    {MailChimp} % Organization
    {Atlanta, GA} % Location
    {October 2012 - May 2016} % Date(s)

        \item {Spearheaded migration from 3rd-party managed hosting to self-managed colocation data centers.}
        \item {Scaled the operations team from 3 to 40 engineers while optimizing infrastructure performance via documentation of the greenfield datacenter implementations, tech talks on subjects such as Puppet development, infrastructure testing, and 1-on-1 mentorship.}
        \item {Migrated high traffic DNS domains from a provider that billed based on usage to Akamai. This reduced costs since billing was no longer traffic based and increased the SLA for DNS.}
        \item {Consolidated hundreds of domain names spread across several registrars to one registrar. This made management of domain names more consistent, provided visibility into domain names that should be added or dropped as necessary, and enabled creation of a customized 'parked page' for unused domains.}

        \item {Developed internal tooling that automatically provisioned servers from 'rack and stack' bare metal to a fully installed OS registered with an in-house CMDB. Same tooling was also used to handle kvm-based virtual provisioning.}
        \item {Implemented configuration management using Puppet, replacing an in-house configuration management tool where development had been abandoned.}

      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Managed >4000 server nodes spread across 6 data centers. Servers were a heterogeneous combination of Solaris, Linux, AIX and Windows.}
        \item {Implemented Puppet to manage server configurations. This increased the consistency of server roll-outs and simplified updating existing configurations.}
        \item {Introduced Cobbler to automate Kickstart installations. The previous Linux build system was either one-off (CD based) or RHN dependent.}
        \item {Designed an automated AWS provisioning system for realistic load testing of public facing applications. Also developed a process for end-user requests that prevented unused instances from remaining active which reduced overall costs.}
